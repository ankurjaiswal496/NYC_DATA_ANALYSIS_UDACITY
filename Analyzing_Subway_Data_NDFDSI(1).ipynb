    "\n",
    "For this project, you will apply the knowledge acquired in the first month of this course. We will practice basic data acquisition and data cleaning tasks to find out fundamental stuff about the data using what we learned in the Statistics course. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between data from the NYC Subway turnstiles and the city weather. For this, besides data from the subway, we will also need data from the weather in NYC. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main points that will be considered in this work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gathering data from the Internet\n",
    "- Using Statistics for Data Analysis\n",
    "- Data handling and simple graphics creation with `Pandas`\n",

Even if the output can still be viewed from the moment you ran your cells in the previews session, the kernel starts in a new state, so you will need to reload all data, etc. in a new session.\n",

If you forget to do this, you will download all files from that page. In order to do this, you can use the following command:\n",
